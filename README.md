# CS370
Operating Systems Class


Course Objectives:
CS370 is a core undergraduate course taken by junior undergraduate students. 
The objective of this course is to understand the broad range of issues that underlie modern Operating Systems.
We focus on key concepts and algorithms that are used in both commercial and open-source operating systems.
This course will cover the following broad areas:

    Basic operating system terminology.
    Processes and thread management.
    Scheduling algorithms
    Memory management concepts.
    Interprocess communication.
    Synchronization
    Deadlocks and resource management
    File System and storage architecture.
    Symmetric multiprocessing.
    Virtualization

We will be covering virtualization as well. 
Virtual machines are used heavily in data centers and provide excellent properties such as isolation, consolidation, and support for legacy applications. 
We will look at Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisors.
